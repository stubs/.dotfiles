# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles for macOS, featuring a modern development environment with Neovim, custom shell configurations, and automated setup.

## üöÄ Quick Start (TL;DR)

**For a brand new Mac:**

```bash
# 1. Clone this repository
git clone <your-repo-url> ~/.dotfiles

# 2. Navigate to the directory
cd ~/.dotfiles

# 3. Run the bootstrap script
./bootstrap.sh

# 4. Restart your terminal (or restart your Mac)

# 5. Setup Neovim plugins:
#    a) Edit init.lua and comment out everything after 'require plugins'
#    b) Open plugins.lua to trigger plugin installation:
nvim ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins.lua
#    c) Wait for plugins to install, then quit
#    d) Uncomment the lines in init.lua
#    e) Restart Neovim
```

That's it! Your development environment is ready.

---

## üîß Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

From your home directory, clone this repository:

```bash
cd ~
git clone <your-repo-url> ~/.dotfiles
```

**Note**: The repository MUST be cloned to `~/.dotfiles` for the stow symlinks to work correctly.

### Step 2: Run Bootstrap

Navigate to the dotfiles directory and run the bootstrap script:

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
chmod +x bootstrap.sh  # Make executable if needed
./bootstrap.sh
```

During installation, you'll be prompted to choose between:
- **home_brewfile**: Personal machine setup
- **work_brewfile**: Work machine setup

Select the appropriate option using the number keys (1 or 2).

### Step 3: Restart

After the script completes:
1. Close your terminal completely
2. Optionally restart your Mac for all changes to take effect
3. Open a new terminal (it should now be using bash instead of zsh)

### Step 4: Neovim Plugin Setup

The Neovim plugins require a special initialization process:

```bash
# 1. Open init.lua and comment out everything after 'require("plugins")'
nvim ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
# Add -- before each line after the plugins require statement

# 2. Open plugins.lua to trigger the plugin manager installation
nvim ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins.lua
# Save the file (:w) and let the plugins install
# You'll see package manager activity in the background
# Wait for installation to complete, then quit (:q)

# 3. Re-open init.lua and uncomment the lines you commented in step 1
nvim ~/.config/nvim/init.lua

# 4. Restart Neovim - everything should now work!
nvim
```

## üîç What the Bootstrap Script Does

The `bootstrap.sh` script automates the entire setup process. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### 1. **Nerd Fonts Installation**
   - Checks if FiraCode Nerd Font is already installed
   - Downloads FiraCode Nerd Font v2.1.0 from GitHub
   - Installs fonts to `~/Library/Fonts/`
   - Cleans up temporary files

### 2. **Homebrew Installation**
   - Checks if Homebrew is installed
   - Installs Homebrew if not present
   - Configures appropriate paths for Intel (x86_64) or Apple Silicon (arm64) Macs

### 3. **Essential GNU Tools**
   Installs critical utilities needed for the bootstrap process:
   - `stow` - Symlink manager for dotfiles
   - `coreutils` - GNU core utilities (better ls, cp, etc.)
   - `grep` - GNU grep (more features than BSD grep)
   - `gnu-sed` - GNU sed (different syntax than BSD sed)

### 4. **Stow Deployment**
   - Scans each directory in the dotfiles repo
   - Removes existing files/directories that would conflict
   - Uses GNU Stow to create symlinks from ~/.dotfiles/* to ~/
   - Files go directly to home directory
   - Subdirectories (like `.config`) are preserved in structure

### 5. **Alacritty Themes**
   - Creates `~/.config/alacritty/themes/` directory
   - Downloads Gruvbox dark and light themes

### 6. **Homebrew Bundle**
   - Prompts you to select home or work Brewfile
   - Installs all packages, apps, and tools defined in the selected Brewfile
   - This includes: CLI tools, GUI applications, fonts, VS Code extensions, etc.
   - Runs `brew cleanup` to remove old versions

### 7. **Shell Change**
   - Adds Homebrew's bash to `/etc/shells` (requires sudo)
   - Changes your default shell from zsh to bash
   - Uses the modern Homebrew-installed bash (not the old macOS system bash)

### 8. **NPM Language Servers**
   - Parses your Neovim LSP config
   - Extracts npm-based language server requirements
   - Installs them globally via npm
   - Provides LSP support for TypeScript, JavaScript, etc.

### 9. **FZF Setup**
   - Installs FZF key bindings for command history (Ctrl+R)
   - Enables fuzzy completion in your shell

### 10. **macOS Defaults**
   - Runs `osxdefaults.sh` script
   - Sets sensible macOS system preferences
   - Customizes Finder, Dock, and other system behaviors

## üé® Post-Installation

After completing the installation and restarting:

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Check that bash is your default shell
echo $SHELL
# Should output: /opt/homebrew/bin/bash (or /usr/local/bin/bash on Intel)

# Check that stow worked
ls -la ~ | grep -E "\.bashrc|\.aliases"
# You should see symlinks pointing to ~/.dotfiles/

# Test Neovim
nvim --version
# Should show Neovim version info
```

### Configure Git

Don't forget to set up your Git identity:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### Explore Your New Setup

- **Shell**: Your terminal now uses bash with custom aliases and functions
- **Aliases**: Type `alias` to see all custom shortcuts defined in `shell/.aliases`
- **Neovim**: Launch with `nvim` - explore the leader key mappings (likely `<space>`)
- **Starship**: Your prompt is now powered by Starship with rich Git info
- **FZF**: Press `Ctrl+R` for fuzzy command history search

---

## üéØ Customization

### Modifying Configurations

Since all dotfiles are symlinked, you can edit them in place:

```bash
# Edit shell aliases
nvim ~/.aliases  # Actually editing ~/.dotfiles/shell/.aliases

# Edit Neovim config
nvim ~/.config/nvim/init.lua  # Actually editing ~/.dotfiles/nvim/.config/nvim/init.lua
```

Changes are automatically reflected in the git repository!

### Adding New Packages

To add new Homebrew packages:

```bash
# Edit the appropriate Brewfile
nvim ~/.dotfiles/brewfiles/home_brewfile  # or work_brewfile

# Add packages under the appropriate section:
# brew "package-name"        # for CLI tools
# cask "app-name"           # for GUI applications
# mas "App Name", id: 123   # for Mac App Store apps

# Install the new packages
brew bundle --file=~/home_brewfile
```

### Adding New Dotfiles

To add a new directory to your dotfiles:

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
mkdir new-tool
# Add your config files to new-tool/
# Run bootstrap.sh again, or manually stow:
stow new-tool
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Bootstrap Script Fails

**Problem**: Script exits with errors

**Solutions**:
- Ensure you have an internet connection
- Check you have enough disk space
- Make sure you have admin privileges (sudo access)
- Try running individual sections manually

### Stow Conflicts

**Problem**: "WARNING: in stow directory, stow conflicts with existing target"

**Solution**:
```bash
# Manually remove the conflicting file
rm ~/.conflicting-file
# Run bootstrap again
./bootstrap.sh
```

### Homebrew Permission Issues

**Problem**: Permission denied errors during `brew install`

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Fix Homebrew permissions
sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(brew --prefix)/*
```

### Neovim Plugins Not Loading

**Problem**: Neovim opens but plugins don't work

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure you followed the Neovim plugin setup steps exactly
2. Try manually installing the plugin manager:
   ```bash
   # For lazy.nvim (most common)
   git clone https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim.git \
     ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/lazy.nvim
   ```
3. Open Neovim and check for errors: `:checkhealth`
4. Reinstall plugins: `:Lazy sync`

### Shell Still Using zsh

**Problem**: Terminal still opens with zsh after restart

**Solutions**:
1. Manually change shell:
   ```bash
   chsh -s $(brew --prefix)/bin/bash
   ```
2. Restart terminal completely (not just new tab)
3. Check System Preferences ‚Üí Users & Groups ‚Üí Advanced Options

### Language Servers Not Working

**Problem**: Neovim LSP features not working

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Reinstall npm language servers
cd ~/.dotfiles
grep -E "npm" nvim/.config/nvim/lua/config/nvim-lspconfig.lua | \
  sed 's/-- npm i -g //g' | \
  xargs npm i -g

# Check LSP status in Neovim
:LspInfo
```

## ü§ù Contributing

This is a personal dotfiles repository, but feel free to:
- Fork it and adapt it to your needs
- Submit issues if you find bugs
- Suggest improvements via pull requests

---

## üìù Notes

- **Backup First**: If you have existing dotfiles, back them up before running bootstrap
- **Review Brewfiles**: Check the Brewfile contents before installation - they install a lot of software
- **Internet Required**: Initial setup downloads several GB of tools and applications
- **Time Required**: First-time setup takes 30-60 minutes depending on your internet speed
- **Shell Change**: The script changes your shell to bash - if you prefer zsh, skip that step
